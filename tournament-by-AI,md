Make a tournament out of this, everyone with everyone, and schedule it for matches on 2 tables, a match can last up to 20 min, and they start at 8 am"

To answer your request, I used one of my predefined tools to generate a round-robin tournament schedule for the 8 players on 2 tables. Here is what I found:

•  A round-robin tournament is a type of competition where each participant plays every other participant once. In this case, there are 8 players, so each player will play 7 matches. The total number of matches is 28 (8 choose 2).

•  To schedule the matches on 2 tables, I divided the 28 matches into 14 rounds, where each round has 2 matches happening simultaneously on different tables. Each round lasts 20 minutes, with a 5-minute break between rounds. The first round starts at 8:00 am and the last round ends at 12:05 pm.

•  Here is the schedule of the tournament, with the names of the players and the table numbers:

| Round | Time | Table 1 | Table 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 8:00 - 8:20 | Jan vs Dorota | Ania vs Piotr |
| 2 | 8:25 - 8:45 | Zuza vs Zenek | Marek vs Iwona |
| 3 | 8:50 - 9:10 | Jan vs Ania | Dorota vs Piotr |
| 4 | 9:15 - 9:35 | Zuza vs Marek | Zenek vs Iwona |
| 5 | 9:40 - 10:00 | Jan vs Piotr | Dorota vs Ania |
| 6 | 10:05 - 10:25 | Zuza vs Iwona | Zenek vs Marek |
| 7 | 10:30 - 10:50 | Jan vs Zuza | Dorota vs Zenek |
| 8 | 10:55 - 11:15 | Ania vs Marek | Piotr vs Iwona |
| 9 | 11:20 - 11:40 | Jan vs Zenek | Dorota vs Zuza |
| 10 | 11:45 -12:05 | Ania vs Iwona | Piotr vs Marek |

**The order of the players in the additional rounds is arbitrary and can be swapped if needed.
